PROJECT_BRIEF = "This project is a game that utilizes Roll, Pitch, and Yaw (RPY) measurements obtained from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The Pitch angle is specifically used to influence the movement of a virtual ball on a platform. Players must carefully adjust the platform's angle to keep the ball balanced and prevent it from falling off. The game provides a fun and interactive way to demonstrate real-time sensor data processing and control."
